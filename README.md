## Conway's Game of Life implementations.

This is kinda my personal exercise in order to learn different languages. Below you can check which languages are already presented in repo and which are in plans:

* C - in plan;
* C++ - in plan;
* Rust - in plan;
* Go - in plan;
* Python - in plan;
* Clojure - in plan.

Implementations are written and tested on Linux machine (x64 Ubuntu 22.04.3). Windows compatibility isn't coming (at least for now).

### How to play?

There are no ready implementations yet.
